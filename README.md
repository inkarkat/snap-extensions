# snap CLI extensions

_Additions and tweaks to the snap CLI._

These are some personal aliases, shortcuts, and extensions that make (my) work with the [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/) command-line utility easier and faster. Some of them may be specific to my environment and workflow, but maybe someone finds a valuable nugget in there.

### Installation

Download all / some selected extensions (note that some have dependencies, though) and put them somewhere in your `PATH`. You can then invoke them via `snap-SUBCOMMAND`.
